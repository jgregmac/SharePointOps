Hello again, SharePoint Site Administrator...
</p>
<p>
You are being contacted one final time because we have detected compatibility problems with one of 
the sites in your SharePoint site collection &quot;-siteURL-&quot;. &nbsp;Because of these problems, 
some or all of the parts of your site may display incorrectly, or not at all. &nbsp;Thus, we urge 
you to review <em>all</em> of your site content to ensure that work on your site will be able to 
continue following the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
The address of the problematic web site within your site collection is:<br/>
<a href="-webURL-">-webURL-</a></br>
As noted previously, you can access a read-only version of the upgraded site at the following 
URL:<br/>
<a href="-newWebURL-">-newWebURL-</a>
</p>
-featureList-
<p>If your site collection contains additional incompatible web sites, you will receive additional 
notifications concerning those sites.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to have the preview version of your site unlocked to aid in troubleshootinf, or if
you need assistance fixing compatibility problems with this web site, please send a message 
indicating this desire to: <a href='mailto:saa-ad@uvm.edu?subject=Need assistance with upgrade of
site: -siteURL-'>saa-ad@uvm.edu</a> and include the URL (address) of your site. &nbsp;We will open 
a problem tracking ticket and identify resources to assist with migrating your existing site 
content to SharePoint 2013.
</p>
<p>
We feel it is important that this upgrade be performed by early Summer of 2014 to ensure 
optimum compatibility between SharePoint and the new mail and calendar service. &nbsp;Since
there is relatively little time left in the semester, please contact us for assistance as soon as 
possible. &nbsp;Early reporting will help us to address any critical site issues <em>before</em> 
the final upgrade.
</p>
