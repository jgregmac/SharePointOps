Hello again, SharePoint Site Administrator...
</p>
<p>
You are being contacted because we have detected compatibility problems with one of the sites in 
the SharePoint site collection &quot;-siteURL-&quot;. &nbsp;You are listed as one of the 
administrators of this collection. &nbsp;We are planning to upgrade the instance of SharePoint on 
which this site collection is hosted from the current &quot;2010 Foundation&quot; version to the 
latest &quot;2013 Standard Edition&quot; sometime in the early Summer of 2015. &nbsp;Unfortunately, 
owing to these problems, your site collection cannot be upgraded automatically.
</p>
<p>
The address of the incompatible web site within the site collection is:<br/>
<a href="-webUrl-">-webURL-</a><br/>
If your site collection contains additional incompatible web sites, you will receive additional 
notifications concerning those sites.
</p>
<p>
If you need to keep this SharePoint web site, please send a message indicating this desire to 
<a href='mailto:saa-ad@uvm.edu?subject=Need assistance with upgrade of site: -siteURL-'>
saa-ad@uvm.edu</a> and include the URL (address) of your site. &nbsp;We will open a problem 
tracking ticket and identify resources to assist with migrating your existing site content to 
SharePoint 2013. &nbsp;If you <em>no longer</em> need this SharePoint web site, you do not need to 
take any further action. &nbsp;However, <em>please note</em> that your site <em>will be deleted</em> 
when the SharePoint 2010 servers are retired.
</p>
<p>
We feel it is important that this upgrade be performed by early Summer of 2014 to ensure 
optimum compatibility between SharePoint and the new mail and calendar service. &nbsp;Since
there is relatively little time left in the semester, please contact us for assistance as soon as 
possible. &nbsp;Early reporting will help us to address any critical site issues <em>before</em> 
the final upgrade.
</p>
