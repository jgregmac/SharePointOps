Hello again, SharePoint Site Administrator...
</p>
<p>
You are being contacted one <em>final</em> time because we have detected compatibility problems with 
one of the sites in the SharePoint site collection &quot;-siteURL-&quot;, for which you are listed 
as a site administrator. &nbsp;We are planning to upgrade the instance of SharePoint on which this 
site collection is hosted from the current &quot;2010 Foundation&quot; version to the latest 
&quot;2013 Standard Edition&quot; sometime in the early Summer of 2015. &nbsp;If you take no action, 
your site <em>will not be migrated</em> to the new version of SharePoint, and <em>will be deleted
</em> shortly after the upgrade is complete.

If you need to keep this SharePoint web site, please send a message indicating this desire to 
<a href='mailto:saa-ad@uvm.edu?subject=Need assistance with upgrade of site: -siteURL-'>
saa-ad@uvm.edu</a> and include the URL (address) of your site. &nbsp;We will open a problem 
tracking ticket and identify resources to assist with migrating your existing site content to 
SharePoint 2013. &nbsp;If you <em>no longer</em> need this SharePoint web site, you do not need to 
take any further action. &nbsp;However, <em>please note</em> that your site <em>will be deleted</em> 
when the SharePoint 2010 servers are retired. &nbsp;The SharePoint 2010 servers will be taken 
offline about one month after the 2013 upgrade has been completed.
</p>
<p>
We feel it is important that this upgrade be performed by early Summer of 2014 to ensure 
optimum compatibility between SharePoint and the new mail and calendar service. &nbsp;Since
there is relatively little time left in the semester, please contact us for assistance as soon as 
possible. &nbsp;Early reporting will help us to address any critical site issues <em>before</em> 
the final upgrade.
