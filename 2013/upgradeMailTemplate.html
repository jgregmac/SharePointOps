    <p>Hello again, SharePoint Site Administrators...</p>
    <p>You are being contacted because you are listed as an administrator for an
    existing site collection hosted in our centrally-managed SharePoint service:
    <br/>https://sharepoint.uvm.edu.</p>
    <p>We are planning to upgrade this instance of SharePoint from the
    current "2010 Foundation" version to the latest 
    &quot;2013 Standard Edition&quot; sometime in the late Spring to early Summer
    of 2015.</p>
    <p>Given the significant visual and functional changes in the new version of
    SharePoint, we want to give you a chance to preview the new look and feel of
    your site before the final upgrade.&nbsp; You now can view an upgraded copy
    of your site, in read-only mode, at the following URL:<br/>
    <a href="-siteURL-">-siteURL-</a></p>
    <p>If you need to make modifications to this preview site as part of your
    preparation for the final upgrade, or if you need to report problems with
    accessing the upgraded version of your site, please write to:<br/>
    &quot;<a href="mailto:saa-ad@uvm.edu?subject=Upgrade of my SharePoint site:
    -siteURL-">saa-ad@uvm.edu</a>&quot; <br/>
    with your site information.&nbsp; Please keep in mind that all changes made
    to this preview site will be destroyed during the final upgrade process.</p>
    <p>The upgrade will involve several major changes to SharePoint:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Upgrade of the core technology from "SharePoint 2010 Foundation"
      to "SharePoint 2013 Standard" <br/>
      (see: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/whats-new-in-microsoft-sharepoint-server-2013-HA102785546.aspx">
      http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/whats-new-in-microsoft-sharepoint-server-2013-HA102785546.aspx</a>.<br/>
      and: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819267.aspx#bkmk_FeaturesOnPremise">
      http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819267.aspx#bkmk_FeaturesOnPremise</a>).
      </li>
      <li>A full visual upgrade of all existing sites to SharePoint 2013 themes.
      </li>
      <li>Replacement of Windows-integrated authentication with UVM's unified
      "WebLogin" interface.</li>
      <li>Introduction of "Managed Metadata Services" as part of the Standard
      Edition upgrade.<br/>
      (See: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee424402(v=office.15).aspx">
      http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee424402(v=office.15).aspx</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>At present, Guest authentication is not working, but we will have this
    feature in place and available for testing before the final upgrade.</p>
    <p>We feel it is critical that this upgrade be performed to ensure optimum
    compatibility between SharePoint and the new mail and calendar service
    which is scheduled to go live for the first pool of users during the Summer
    of 2015.</p>
