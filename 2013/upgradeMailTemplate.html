Hello again, SharePoint Site Administrators...
</p>
<p>
You are being contacted because you are listed as an administrator for an
existing site collection hosted in our centrally-managed SharePoint service at 
https://sharepoint.uvm.edu. &nbsp;We are planning to upgrade this instance of 
SharePoint from the current "2010 Foundation" version to the latest 
&quot;2013 Standard Edition&quot; sometime in the late Spring to early Summer
of 2015.
</p>
<p>
Given the significant visual and functional changes in SharePoint 2013, we want to give you a 
chance to preview the new look and feel of your site before the final upgrade. &nbsp;You now can 
view an upgraded, <em>read-only</em> copy of your site at the following URL:<br/>
<a href="-siteURL-">-siteURL-</a>
</p>
<p>
If you find that part (or all) of your upgraded site is not working properly, please send a help 
request to &quot;<a href="mailto:saa-ad@uvm.edu?subject=Upgrade of my SharePoint site: -siteURL-">
saa-ad@uvm.edu</a>&quot;, and we will open a support ticket to track your problem.
</p>
<p>
Some people may find it necessary to have write access to their sites in order to complete
testing of the site upgrades.&nbsp; If this is the case for you, send a site unlock request
to the email address above. &nbsp;Please keep in mind that any data written to these test 
sites will <em>not</em> be preserved.&nbsp; Any customizations or new data written to the 
test sites <em>will be destroyed</em> during the final upgrade process.
</p>
<p>The upgrade will involve several major changes to SharePoint:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade of the core technology from "SharePoint 2010 Foundation"
to "SharePoint 2013 Standard" <br/>
(see: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/whats-new-in-microsoft-sharepoint-server-2013-HA102785546.aspx">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/whats-new-in-microsoft-sharepoint-server-2013-HA102785546.aspx</a>.<br/>
and: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819267.aspx#bkmk_FeaturesOnPremise">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj819267.aspx#bkmk_FeaturesOnPremise</a>).</li>
<li>A full visual upgrade of all existing sites to SharePoint 2013 themes.</li>
<li>Replacement of Windows-integrated authentication with UVM's unified "WebLogin" interface.</li>
<li>Introduction of "Managed Metadata Services" as part of the Standard Edition upgrade.<br/>
(See: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee424402(v=office.15).aspx">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee424402(v=office.15).aspx</a>)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
At present, GuestNet authentication is not working, but we will have this feature in place and 
available for testing before the final upgrade.
</p>
<p>
We feel it is important that this upgrade be performed by early Summer of 2014 to ensure 
optimum compatibility between SharePoint and the new mail and calendar service. &nbsp;Since
there is relatively little time left in the semester, please try to report any problems with
your upgraded site as soon as possible. &nbsp;Early reporting will help us to address any
critical site issues <em>before</em> the final upgrade.
